TODO (High Level)
	DONE - Finish authentication
	DONE - Add API support (probably Jisho since JMDict didn't work so well while testing it)
	- Fix layout (it looks ugly right now)
	- Make testing page
	- Make styling consistent
	- Make sure JSHint sees no errors



TODO (Specifics)
	DONE - Search should be done in clientside JS (Javascript form likely)
	- Should remove "createdBy" stuff after adding authentication
	DONE - "Sign Up" and "Login" should disappear once someone has logged in
	DONE - Should also refactor everything for sessions after adding authentication
	- Expand home page
	- Lists page looks horrible at the moment
	- "Words to Add" passes in a spaced text of words, but I can't seem to split based on spaces. Figure out why



NOTES
	NOPE - Do we want to allow people to still create lists while not logged in?
	- Bootstrap vertical forms have too long input fields, but horizontal forms look bad. Probably can change with width in vertical
	WHY NOT BOTH - Do we want people to add words while making the list or just do it later in the actual list after creation?
	- Navbar looks kind of boring, tweak it a little maybe
